# Deep Learning Projects using Tensorflow(Keras)

These projects are examples towards learning Deep Learning Framework. They are self contained jupyter notebooks to be run in colab enviromnent.
It uses Tensorfloww Framework and keras API.

The topics explored so far are as follows.
1) Classification of IMDb reviews - `BinaryClassifier.ipynb` ( Binary Classification ) 
2) Housing price prediction -  `regression_HousingPricePrediction.ipynb` ( Regression ) 
3) News Topic Classification - `multiclassClassification_Reuters_dataset.ipynb` (Multiclass Classification)
4) Deploying Fashion MNIST CNN based classifier using Tensorflow ModelServer - `Fashion_MNIST_Deployment.ipynb` (Deploying TF models)

## This repository is a work in progress.
